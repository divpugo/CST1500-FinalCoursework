# CST1500-FinalCoursework
The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly calculator which offers both basic as well as scientific functionalities, integrated in a fully functional Graphical User Interface (GUI). The programming language used throughout the program is Python 3.8. and the GUI programming toolkit used is Tkinter.  
As part of a basic calculator, this program allows the user to perform the following basic operations: 
➢	Addition 
➢	Subtraction 
➢	Multiplication 
➢	Division 
➢	Equal 
➢	Clear 
Each of the mathematical functions operate with full precision without rounding and missing decimals. 
In addition to the simple calculations, scientific aspects of a calculator have been implemented. Namely: 
➢	Square Root 
➢	Logarithmic functions 
➢	Trigonometric functions such as: 
o	sin(x) o cos(x) o tan(x) 
➢	Mathematical constants such as: 
o	Pi 
➢	Modulus
